Graveller dice roll to 'compete' with Austin :)

If I may, your implementation was pretty darn good, you used more efficient libraries like repeat and the use of random.choice as apposed to random.randint. While I could've used another language I thought it'd be fun to use python as it's the most enjoyable language that I don't get to use too often and the major thing I did differently was parallelizing the whole program. Many other people will make things far more impressive than me but on my system I managed to get a 4.5x~ runtime uplift over your implementation. Plus the bonus is that that performance increase will be even larger on a better PC than mine.
